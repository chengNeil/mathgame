        <p>General Rules

1.     Every question that the game generates is displayed underneath the cursor and moves when the player moves the cursor within the game area.

2.      For every generated question, the game must generate 9 possible answers, one correct answer and 8 incorrect answers. The 9 possible answers must all be generated on a separate fruit, similarly as shown in Figure 1.3.The generated answers (fruits) must be moving around throughout the game.

3.     The player aim for every question is to click on the fruit that he/she thinks is the correct answer to the generated question.
a.     If the chosen fruit is the correct answer then the player should be awarded points and a new question should be generated with nine (9) new answers and the number of “hits” should be incremented. The number of “hits” represents, the number of correct answers acquired in a given level.

b.     However, if the chosen fruit is an incorrect answer then the player points should be decreased (the minimum points the player can have is zero).Also, a new question should be generated with new nine (9) answers and the number of “misses” should be incremented. The number of “misses” represents the number of incorrect answers acquired in a given level.

4.     Note, the game will end if the player reaches their maximum number of misses for the game, that is, 6 incorrect answers, or if the player successfully complete level 3.</p>
